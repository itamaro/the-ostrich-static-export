== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Google Adsense plugin installed, but it does not appear in the list of plugins in the Wordpress admin dashboard. Why? =

It is possible that you have AdBlock browser extension (or similar software) installed in your browser and it blocks ads. Disable AdBlock extension to see the Adsense plugin and make necessary changes.

= Adsense plugin doesn't work (ads not displaying). What should I do? =

Please complete the following steps:
1. Setup your Google Adsense account.
2. Make sure that your Wordpress theme contains necessary hooks for ads displaying (the_content, wp_footer, etc). If you don't know how to check that, just install any official Wordpress theme (for example, [Twenty Sixteen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/)) and check if the ads are displayed. If yes, it means that the necessary hooks are missing in your theme.
3. Make sure Adblock (or similar browser extensions) is disabled in your browser.

= What is the maximum number of Google ads displayed on a single page? =

The max number of ads allowed by Google is three (per one page). That is why you can post three ads on the home page if the page is represented as posts with pagination. If it's a static page with content, the ad will be displayed once and not in the widget, but below the page text. [More info](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1346295?hl=en#Ad_limit_per_page)

= Why I cannot choose more than one ad block in the widget tab? =

This limitation is caused by the maximum allowable number of ad blocks to be displayed on the page. Ad blocks display can only be set in the post; in this case, it will not be displayed on the page. However, a widget is usually displayed in every post and every page.

= How to add Google Adsense block to the sidebar? =

Follow the next steps in order to add the Google Adsense block to the sidebar:
1. Open your Wordpress admin dashboard.
2. Make sure that Google Adsense plugin is installed and activated.
3. Navigate to the Appearance > Widgets section and add the Google Adsense widget to the available sidebar.

= How do I see my reporting/stats? Will it show up on my Google Adsense account? When? =

If everything is correct, you will see it in your Google Adsense account.

= I have some problems with the plugin's work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support? =

Please make sure that the problem hasn't been discussed yet on our forum (<https://support.bestwebsoft.com>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem's description:
- The link to the page where the problem occurs
- The name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version - your order number.
- The version of your WordPress installation
- Copy and paste into the message your system status report. Please read more here: [Instruction on System Status](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wi2X8RdRGXk9kMszQy1xItJrpN0ncXgioH935MaBKtc/)
